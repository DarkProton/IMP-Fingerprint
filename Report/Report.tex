\section{Introduction}
	Fingerprints have been used to identify people since the 19\textsuperscript{th} century and have been used in criminal investigations since about that time. More recently fingerprints have been used as biometric markers used in boarder control, library stock control and computer and building access control systems. The need for a robust automatic fingerprint recognition system is obvious.

	Most fingerprint recognition systems in use are based on the idea of identifying minutiae (points where a ridge ends or joins with another ridge) --- in this article a system that uses the greylevel gradient to find minutiae is discussed.

        Traditionally, fingerprint analysis consisted of first processing the image in some way, usually either binarization or line thinning. Methods like this have two major drawbacks. Firstly, such alterations to the image can be computationally expensive and therefore take a considerable amount of time for large images, which is a serious problem when used in real time applications. Secondly, non-reversible image manipulation can lead to destruction of information about the fingerprint.


\section{Theory and Implementation}

        The method used in the article does not rely on prior image manipulation. It works by think of the image as a three dimensional object, with the greylevel of time image being the height in the Z-direction. The tangent of this object is then calculated at the position of each pixel in the image. A line can then be traced along the image by taking steps in the direction orthogonal to these tangents. By building up such lines from different starting points in the image, we can classify the entirety of the fingerprint. The two types of minutia we are looking for can be found from this complete classification. Where a line ends without touching another line or the edge of the image is a termination and points where one line hits the middle of another are bifurcations.


	\subsection{Point Normal Direction}
\begin{figure*}
\centering
\includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{PND}
\caption{Flow chart of the PND function as implemented.}
\label{fig:PND-alg}
\end{figure*}

		The point normal function works by taking four mutually adjacent points (\textit{i.e.} a $2 \times 2$ array of pixels) and fitting a plane to them. If the greylevel at the pixel $(x_k, y_k)$ is denoted $h_k$ and the level from the fitted plane is denoted $p_k$ then the plane fitting part of the function can be seen as minimising the following expression:

		\begin{equation}
			\min_{n_1, n_2, c} \sum_k |h_k - p_k|^2
		\end{equation}
		
		Which in matrix form can be expresed as:

		\begin{equation}
			\begin{vmatrix}
			\begin{pmatrix}
			h_1 \\
			h_2 \\
			h_3 \\
			h_4
			\end{pmatrix}
			-
			\begin{pmatrix}
			-x_1 & -y_1 & 1 \\
			-x_2 & -y_2 & 1 \\
			-x_3 & -y_3 & 1 \\
			-x_4 & -y_4 & 1
			\end{pmatrix}
			\begin{pmatrix}
			n_1 \\
			n_2 \\
			c
			\end{pmatrix}
			\end{vmatrix}^2
		\end{equation}

		Where $n_1$, $n_2$ and $c$ are the $x$, $y$ and $z$ components of the surface normal respectively. This is a simple least-squares minimisation and after some rearranging we obtain the following expressions for the optimum surface normal:

		\begin{equation}
		\begin{split}
			n_1 = \frac{-h_1 + h_2 + h_3 - h_4}{4} \\
			n_2 = \frac{-h_1 - h_2 + h_3 + h_4}{4} \\
			c = \frac{h_1 + h_2 + h_3 + h_4}{4}
		\end{split}
		\end{equation}

		Since we are only concerned with the components in the $x,y$--plane the function implemented here doesn't bother calculating $c$ (figure \ref{fig:PND-alg}). Once all $2 \times 2$ neighbourhoods have been fitted the function returns $n_1$ and $n_2$ then terminates.

		As the NPD function needs a four points to fit a plane to the decision has to be made regarding how edges are handled. One possibility is to `wrap' the edges of the image around, effectively forming a torus --- this was not implemented here because it would mean that for two edges the values of $n_1$ and $n_2$ would depend on greylevels from the other two edges. The second possibility (implemented here) is to make the output array smaller by 1 pixel in both dimensions, so if the original image is $n \times m$ pixels the array of normals is $(n-1) \times (m-1)$. From figure \ref{fig:PND-alg} it can be seen that the PND function implemented here loses the top and right hand pixels.

	\subsection{Averaged Tangent Direction}
        \begin{figure*}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{ATD.png}
        \caption{Flow chart of the ATD function as implemented.}
        \label{fig:ATD-alg}
      \end{figure*}
		The ATD function calculates the $x,y$--plane tangent that best fits with the surface normals generated by the PND function in a given $n \times n$ neighbourhood. This has the effect of smoothing out (plane normal angle) noise but, as with analogous smoothing operations, can obscure features with a size comparable to that of the kernel chosen. The fitting is a least squares minimisation of the row-by-row dot product:

		\begin{equation}
		\begin{split}
			\min_{u_1, u_2} \sum_k |(n_{1,k}, n_{2,k}) \cdot (u_1, u_2)|^2 \\
			= U(u_1, u_2)
		\end{split}
		\end{equation}

		Where $n_{1,k}$ is the $k$\textsuperscript{th} $n_1$ value as defined above \textit{e.t.c.} and $(u_1, u_2)$ is the normalised fitted vector. If we define the following:

		\begin{equation}
		\begin{split}
			A = \sum_k (n_{1,k})^2 \\
			B = \sum_k (n_{2,k})^2 \\
			C = \sum_k n_{1,k} n_{2,k}
		\end{split}
		\end{equation}

		then we can express $U(u_1, u_2)$ as

		\begin{equation}\label{eq:U_mat}
		\begin{split}
			U(u_1, u_2) = \\ (u_1, u_2)
			\begin{pmatrix}
			A & C \\
			C & B
			\end{pmatrix}
			\begin{pmatrix}
			u_1\\
			u_2
			\end{pmatrix}
		\end{split}
		\end{equation}

		The eigenvalues of the above $2 \times 2$ matrix, $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$, are the maximum and minimum values of $U$ respectively. It is trivial to determine that the two eigenvalues are given by:

		\begin{equation}
		\begin{split}
			\lambda_1 = \frac{A + B + \sqrt{(A - B)^2 + 4C^2}}{4} \\
			\lambda_2 = \frac{A + B - \sqrt{(A - B)^2 + 4C^2}}{4}
		\end{split}
		\end{equation}

		With some further rearranging of equation \eqref{eq:U_mat} we find that:

		\begin{equation}\label{eq:ATD_u}
			u_1 = \sqrt{\frac{1}{1 + \left(\frac{\lambda_2 - A}{C}\right)^2}}
		\end{equation}

		\begin{equation}
			u_2 = u_1 \left(\frac{\lambda_2 - A}{C}\right)
		\end{equation}

		In implementing these equations several special cases have to be taken into account. The first special case is when $C = 0$, which would require deviding by zero. To cope with this case the function is set to test if $C = 0$ and if so the function will set $(u_1, u_2) = (1,0)$ or $(u_1, u_2) = (0,1)$ depending on weather $A < B$ or $B > A$ respectively. The second special case is  when $\lambda_1 = \lambda_2$, which the function tests for after determining if $C = 0$. In this case there is no optimum orientations thus $(u_1, u_2) = (0,0)$.

		A final problem with implementing equation \eqref{eq:ATD_u} is the fact that $u_1$ can only ever be positive. This ensures that in the $x$--direction one cannot distinguish between the two sides edges of a ridge. To solve this the function calculates the mean of the $n_1$ values then checks if this mean is negative and if so it makes $u_1$ negative.

	\subsection{The Ridge Follower}
		The ridge following system takes a slice (of width $2 \sigma + 1$ and height 1 pixel centred around pixel $(x_c, y_c)$) of the image, finds the peak of the ridge and moves to it, calculates the direction of the ridge ($\phi_c$) then moves forward by $\mu$ pixels before starting the process again (figure \ref{fig:ridge_follow_simpled}). In this manor the ridge follower follows the ridge, and since the function logs where it's been it's possible to determine where the minutiae are.

\begin{figurehere}
\centering
\includegraphics[width = 0.48\textwidth]{ridge_follow_simpled}
\caption{Simple version of the ridge following algorithm.}
\label{fig:ridge_follow_simpled}
\end{figurehere}

		Taking a line at a given point is simple enough: the current pixel, $(x_c, y_c)$, is the centre of the line and by simple trig the coordinates of the pixels that make up the line are

		\begin{equation}
		\begin{split}
			\begin{pmatrix}
			x_{l,k} \\
			y_{l,k}
			\end{pmatrix}
			= \\
			\begin{pmatrix}
			x_c \\
			y_c
			\end{pmatrix}
			+ (k - \sigma)
			\begin{pmatrix}
			\cos{(\phi_c + \pi/2)} \\
			\sin{(\phi_c + \pi/2)}
			\end{pmatrix}
		\end{split}
		\end{equation}

		where $x_{l,k}$ is $x$--coordinate of the $k$\textsuperscript{th} pixel of the line \textit{e.t.c.} and $k$ ranges from zero to $2 \sigma + 1$. Using these coordinates one can extract the relevant greylevels and plane normals.

		Identifying the peak of the ridge is somewhat involved if noise tolerance is needed. One method is to find the point midway between the two angles that are closest to the end of the lines. Another method is to try and smooth out the ridge to ensure that there is just one peak in it - by taking the average of a line in front of and behind the current point then convolving along the line with a Gaussian mask one can effectively find the `weak' maxima of the ridge. This weak maxima may not be the actual centre of the ridge but it should be near enough.

In the algorithm employed here a more simplistic (and not as noise tolerant) method that simply finds the darkest point in the line. This method is vulnerable to local minima due to noise and has no way of coping with plateau ridges.

		Calculating $\phi_c$ is trivial but demands that some care to be taken. Using the result of the PND or ATD functions one can easily determine the angle of the greylevel tangent and add or subtract $pi/2$ from the angles to get $\phi_c$. In the algorithim implemented here the two possible values of $\phi_c$ are compared to the old value of $\phi_c$ and the one with the smallest difference is chosen.

		Moving forward is trivial. Using basic trigonometry one can see that the following is true:

		\begin{equation}
			\begin{pmatrix}
			x_{c+1} \\
			y_{c+1}
			\end{pmatrix}
			=
			\begin{pmatrix}
			x_c \\
			y_c
			\end{pmatrix}
			+ \mu
			\begin{pmatrix}
			\cos{\phi_c} \\
			\sin{\phi_c}
			\end{pmatrix}
		\end{equation}

\section{Results \& Analysis}
	In order to test the various functions we use several images, shown in figure \ref{fig:ex_img}. Each of these images present their own challenges: \ref{fig:Example_curve_n0}, \ref{fig:Example_curve_n50} and \ref{fig:fingerprint5} all have quite wide ridges that plateau while \ref{fig:Example_curve_n50} and \ref{fig:arch} both have significant levels of noise that, if not properly dealt with, could easily lead to the ridge follower missing the true path of a ridge.

	\subsection{The PND function}
			\begin{figure*}

				\subfloat[Simple wide curve.]{\label{fig:PND_Example_curve_n0}

				\caption{Sections of the example images after the PND function has been applied.}
				\label{fig:PND_img}
			\end{figure*}

		As can be seen in figures \ref{fig:PND_Example_curve_n0} and \ref{fig:PND_fingerprint5_small} the PND function does correctly calculate surface normals for a noise free image. It should be noted that in the system developed here black represents a low pixel value while white is high (as is standard for greyscale images), hence the normals point towards the black regions rather than away.

		If PND is applied to \ref{fig:Example_curve_n50} however, result is not as satisfactory (figure \ref{fig:PND_Example_curve_n50}). The point normals at the edge of the line do point towatds the line however as the PND function has no way of smothing out noise vectors scatter the image like mines in a playground\footnote{By which I mean that the mines are unwelcome and would mame children if not delt with}. In the case of scan of a real fingerprint the noise does not seam to have been an issue. Some normals are incorrectly angled but most are pointing in the right direction.

		Overall it appears that on it's own the PND function can cope with some smudging and blured images as long as the ridges are still present but cannot cope with white noise, especally if the image has well sparsed ridges and large monochromatic areas.

	\subsection{The ATD Function}
			\begin{figure*}
				\centering
				\subfloat[Simple wide curve.]{\label{fig:ATD_Example_curve_n0_5}
					\includegraphics[width = 0.48\textwidth]{ATD_Example_curve_n0_5}} \;
				\subfloat[Simple wide curve with noise added.]{\label{fig:ATD_Example_curve_n50_5}
					\includegraphics[width = 0.48\textwidth]{ATD_Example_curve_n50_5}} \\

				\caption{Sections of the example images after the ATD function has been applied with a window size of 5.}
				\label{fig:ATD_img}
			\end{figure*}

		The results of the ATD function are not as encouraging as the PND results. Looking at figures \ref{fig:ATD_Example_curve_n0_5} and \ref{fig:ATD_fingerprint5_small_5} we can see that the function has spread the normals of the edges into regions that had no normal from the PND function (which is as expected) but most critically for certain sections the function calculates the direction of some of the vectors wrong. This appears to happen for sections that are nearly horizontal but is probably not due to the function incorrectly picking the case where $(u_1, u_2) = (0, 1)$, which can be seen the vectors pointing in opposing directions on opposite sides of the line. The bug may be due to a floating point error but at the time of writing the exact nature of the bug is unknown.

		For white noise the ATD function does not appear to help. Both the random noise normals and the actual edge normals have been merged, though a line correctly oriented normals does remain (ignoring the sections where the above mentioned malfunction occurs). For the real fingerprint the ATD function does seam to have improved the situation, with the normals in the blurred sections becoming properly oriented. If a larger window is used on this image, figure \ref{fig:ATD_arch_15}, one can see the effect of over smoothing the normals --- in the sections that are blurred the over smoothing had set all normals to the same direction. Setting the ATD window too large also appears to eliminate some of the ridges which again isn't surprising.

\begin{figurehere}
\centering
\includegraphics[width = 0.48\textwidth]{ATD_arch_15}
\caption{The result of applying the ATD function to the real fingerprint with window size of 15.}
\label{fig:ATD_arch_15}
\end{figurehere}

	\subsection{The Ridge Follower}
			\begin{figure*}
				\centering
				\subfloat[Path of the ridge follower.]{\label{fig:RF_arch}
					\includegraphics[width = 0.45\textwidth]{RF_arch}} \;
				\subfloat[Normals generated by ATD function.]{\label{fig:RF_ATD_arch}

				\caption{Result of applying the ridge follower to the output of the ATD function ($\mu = 2$, $\sigma = 2$, ATD window size set to 5).}
				\label{fig:RF_img}
			\end{figure*}

		The results here are not encouraging - the ridge following algorithm, as implemented here, seams to switch between following a ridge and moving across ridges (figure \ref{fig:RF_arch}). This occurs independently of the previously mentioned bug in ATD (figure \ref{fig:RF_ATD_arch}). This problem may be down to how the function decides what the new value of $\phi_s$ is.

\section{Conclusion}
	A functioning system for computing the plane normal directions of a greyscale has been written and on testing was found to work well. This PND function has no way of dealing with noise hence a second function, the averaged tangent direction function, is necessary. On images with large uniform areas and white noise the ATD function is of little use however when tested with real fingerprints this is not a problem. It is found that when selecting the size of the window used by the ATD function it is important to not select a size that over smooths the normals.
